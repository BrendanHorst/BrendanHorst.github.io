      <h3>Tetris in Javascript</h3>

      <p>In high school I took AP Computer Software Principles, and for
        our final project I and another student decided to try and recreate the
        game Tetris using javascript. We used a website called CodeHS in class
        so this was also using CodeHS's API.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, high school doesn't touch git or GitHub, and I don't have
        the original source code for it anymore.</p>

      <a href="https://codehs.com/share/nBzucOinrT7WIc3OTSxO">If you want to
        play it, click me!</a>

      <p>You'll find that this isn't a very advanced version of Tetris. There's
        no holding, no hard drops, and no bonus points for combos or t-spins.
        Our goal for this project wasn't to introduce a revolutionary,
        competitively-viable version of tetris, only to get it working and playable.
        And we succeeded!</p>

      <p>The parts that I worked on were the piece rotating, line clearing, and
        piece order randomizer.</p>

      <p>At first I tried experimenting with piece rotation
        by having each piece be a single object and rotating that object. Simple,
        right? Well, when lines get cleared, it only clears the individual blocks,
        not entire pieces, so each block whithin a piece had to be seperate.
        What I did was put each piece into one of four states depending on what
        direction is was visually facing, and what state the current piece was in
        would determine how each square would move when the up button was pressed.</p>

      <p>Once the pieces themselves were figured out, as well as how they would
        rotate, line clearing ended up being a lot simpler than I thought it would.
        I just set up a loop that looked at each row, starting from the bottom,
        and checked if every space in the row was occupied. If it returned true,
        then I went through every single square with a y-value greater than the
        current row and lowered their y-value by however many pixels a square was.
        This loop would run every single time a piece locked into place. It's
        not super efficient, but Tetris doesn't do a whole lot else so it wasn't
        a problem.</p>

      <p>The piece order randomizer was interesting. It seems obvious. There are
        7 pieces, just randomly generate a number from 1 to 7 and deploy the piece
        that corresponds with said number. That is what I did initially, but I
        encountered a problem while testing. 100% randomness isn't very fun.
        With only 7 pieces, it was not uncommon to get the same piece 2, 3, even
        4 or more times in a row. Sometimes one specific piece would fail to
        show up for long periods of time. After doing some research, I discovered
        a solution. I would scramble the pieces in sets of 7. This way a piece
        could only show up 2 times in a row at most, and two of the same piece
        would never be more than 12 pieces apart. If you play it for yourself,
        that's what the output below the game window is testing. </p>

      <p>The only major problems with the program that I didn't get to fix before
        AP test season came around were that there is no check if rotation is
        possible before attempting to rotate, nor is there a check to see if
        there are any squares in the way before moving horizontally, both of
        which result in clipping. And it gets very buggy when clipping starts to
        happen. But other than that, it's perfectly
        playable!</p>
