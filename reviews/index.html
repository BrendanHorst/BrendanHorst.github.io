      <p>Who doesn't like video games? You? Well I do, so I'm gonna write about
        them. Whether it's games I want to gush about, games I want to rant
        angrily about, or other video game related topics I want to share my
        thoughts on, this is where you'll find all of that.</p>

      <h2>Music Reviews</h2>

      <p>Want to hear my thoughts about music I like? Maybe discover an artist
        you've never heard of? Read an overly long analysis about a game
        soundtrack? Well you're in luck, because I've got all of that right
        here.</p>
