      <h2>Is a gameboy an instrument?</h2>

      <p>Yes, yes it is. I don't just mean ost's to gameboy games, I mean songs
        that are composed on gameboy hardware, or use soundfonts similar to that
        of a gameboy. They're called chiptunes</p>

      <p>One of my favorite chiptune albums is Parellel Processing by Danimal Cannon
        and Zef.</p>

      <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 720px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2038689466/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=0f91ff/transparent=true/" seamless><a
          href="http://danimalcannon.bandcamp.com/album/parallel-processing">Parallel Processing by Danimal Cannon and Zef</a></iframe>

      <p class="addtopmargin">One of the common pitfalls of chiptune music is that songs from inexperienced
        artists can sound a little empty due to the limited hardware. While many
        artists get around this by adding extra instruments or synths, Parellel
        Processing avoids this by being mostly composed on two gameboys rather
        than just one. The result is an album jam packed with catchy melodies
        and hard-hitting basslines that most gameboy games from back in the day
        wished they had.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Logic Gatekeeper
          <p>My favorite track on the album. It perfectly captures the spirit of
            Parallel Processing and serves as a great intro for what the album is
            entails, with fast-paced, punchy melodies at
            both ends tied together seamlessly with a middle section that is
            more subdued but still retains the energy of the rest of the track.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Legacy
          <p>This was the first song I ever heard from Danimal Cannon, as it was
            featured in the trailer for the Pokemon Generations youtube series,
            and for good reason. The slower tempo of this piece combined with the
            low melody and steady percussion gives this piece a heroic vibe, like
            you're approaching the end of a grand adventure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Chronos
          <p>Were the previous tracks not dubstep-y enough for you? Because this
            song is probably the closest you can get on a gameboy. It's pure
            ear candy, and I find it's near impossible to not tap my foot to the
            beat when the bass kicks in, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Rhapsody
          <p>I don't really have a whole lot to say about this one. It's more
            melodic and happy than the rest of the album, and while I don't think
            it stands out that much, it still has that great Danimal Cannon vibe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Glitch
          <p>This one is Zef's solo track on the album, and his style definitely
            helps this one stand out. It's very fast paced and kind of all over the
            place. While this means it's not super memorable, it is still fun,
            and it's got enough variety in it to keep it interesting throughout.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The Lunar Whale
          <p>This one's a Danimal Cannon solo track, and it's one of the best.
            Some parts are very punchy and wild, some parts are very melodic,
            and all parts are equally memorable and fun to listen to. Also, I can't
            not bring up the part at 00:42, the rhythm is so weird but it's so fun
            to listen to; it's definitely the part of the song that I think of the most.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Corrupted
          <p>After Danimal Cannon and Zef both get their solo tracks, they come
            back together for Corrupted, which is the most thematically
            interesting track on the album. It starts with a simple melody, then
            continues to add on it for two minutes before building up to a very
            satisfying drop with a fantastic melody, and satisfying drops are, I find,
            pretty rare in chiptune music. The second half of the song even uses
            some compressed voice samples, which helps this track stand out even more</p>
        </li>
        <li>Parallel Processing
          <p>Sharing the same name, I think this track is a great finale for
            the album, much like how Logic Gatekeeper is a great intro. It's really
            long, at 8 minutes, which allows it to have a lot of variety throughout,
            with calm parts and heavier parts, capturing the essence of the whole album.
            Despite this however, I feel like this track gets heavily overshadowed by
            the big hitters of the album, especially Corrupted, as it came just before.
            Very ironic, given its name.</p>
